# Expenses App - Alkemy Challenge 

This project is part of the FullStack JS Alkemy Challenge and consists of a webapp to track incomes and outcomes.
The server was made with Express JS, the Database with mySql using the ORM Sequelize, and the Frontend using React JS.


# Run this app
You can clone this repo using the command: git clone https://github.com/mcdzo/expenses-app.git

Once you've done it, remember to install the dependencies needed to run it with the command: npm install

# .env file

The server has an authentication middleware, so you need to create a .env file containing a variable called "TOKEN_KEY" in order to generate the JWTOKENS needed to authenticate users.
Give it whatever value you want.
